; Lissabon dimmers use the Joy-iT DEBO JT ESP32 board.
; Because it is cheap, and has enough I/O pins. It is
; a clone of the nodemcu-32, apparently.
; It was originally selected because the 3v3 regulator
; is 12V-safe, but the power led isn't and the regulator
; gets very hot, so using a Pololu now.
; It does not have lipo-charging, but that isn't needed
; for this project.
